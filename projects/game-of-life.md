### YouTube recommendation project idea

On my YouTube recommendation page, I found this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2vgICfQawE. That is John Conway's Game Of Life simulation with a lot of cool stuff in it. So instantly I wanted to create my version of it. And I did üòÅ

Ah also, I've been recently watching A LOT of javidx9. That's why I decided to do it in a Windows console.
