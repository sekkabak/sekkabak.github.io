### YouTube recommendation project idea

On my YouTube recommendation page, I found this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2vgICfQawE
That is John Conway's Game Of Life simulation with a lot of cool stuff created. So instantly I wanted to create my own. So I did it üòÅ

Ah also, I watch recently watch javidx9 A LOT. So I decided to do it in Windows console.
