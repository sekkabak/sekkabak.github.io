Back in the past, I wrote a lot of programs in C# as my off projects in technical education. Sadly it's all gone except my entires to math/programming competition. Fractals always look cool for me. I enjoyed creating complicated-looking graphic stuff, so I started in the competition and created this. Unfortunately, the application is created in my native language polish.

However visual generators are awesome and elastic üòÄ
