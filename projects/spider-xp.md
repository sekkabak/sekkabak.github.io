### I created a clone of Microsoft's Spider solitaire

With Windows XP, I always like to play Spider Solitaire. The game was relaxing and addictive at the same time. Today while I'm using Windows 10, all solitaire games look so "polished" therefore, I decided to recreate the old good one XP Spider. The whole game is created on Java Swing.
