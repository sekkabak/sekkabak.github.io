    I implemented "BÃ©zier curves". <br> 
    I know that is my code because nobody could write that <br> 
    much spaghetti code in just a few lines ðŸ˜‚ <br>
    Now I see how much knowledge I gained over just a few years.

    I think that the most advanced tool that I created in this application is this highly customizable curve generator. There are few premade presets, but u could edit formula with js dialect. Custom parameters, color, draw time, steps, draw precision and cool glowing border ðŸ˜…

        Now a fun part. I "invented" curve drawing algorithm. On paper, everything looks good, but when I implemented "this" ... I knew that my brand new algorithm is ... garbage. In most cases, the "curve" itself wasn't a curve. But I had no time to figure something new, so I left it.

More fun, but this time working stuff. I "invented" vector-based encoding and decoding. It's more like QR code because it's reading/writing dots. And I cheated with decoding A LOT. I couldn't figure out how to read the plot data back to my array of dots. Then ... I colored it ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ don't ask ...
